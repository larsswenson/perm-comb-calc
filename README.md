# Permutations and Combinations Calculator

This Python program calculates the number of permutations and combinations based on user input. 
It allows the user to enter the values for \( n \) (total items) and \( r \) (items to be chosen or arranged) and then displays the results. 
The program also includes test cases to demonstrate its functionality.

## Features

- Takes user input to define \( n \) (total items) and \( r \) (items to be chosen or arranged).
- Calculates and displays:
  - The number of permutations \( P(n, r) \)
  - The number of combinations \( C(n, r) \)
- Includes test cases to validate functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo or download the script.
2. Run the script using Python 3.x.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the values for \( n \) and \( r \).

### Running the Program

```
python3 permutations_combinations.py
```

## Test Cases

The program includes several test cases to validate functionality, covering both normal and edge cases.

### Running Tests

The test cases are executed automatically when the script is run. If all test cases pass, the program will then prompt for user input.
